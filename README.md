## Tech Stack
- **SQL:** Data is queried and manipulated using SQL for database operations in this dashboard development. 

- **Power BI:** The dashboard is developed using Power BI for data visualization and analysis.

## SQL Code
Below is the snippet of the SQL query used to create a new table for dashboard development:
```sql
with cte as (
select * from bike_share_yr_0
union all
select * from bike_share_yr_1)

select
dteday,
season,
a.yr,
weekday,
hr,
rider_type,
riders,
price,
COGS,
riders * price as revenue,
riders * price - COGS as profit
from cte a
left join cost_table b
on a.yr = b.yr
```

## Features
- **Total Riders and Profitability:** The bike-sharing service has 3 million riders with a profit margin of 45.4%.
- **Financial Performance:** Total profit is $10.45 million, and total revenue is $15 million.
- **Seasonal Revenue:** Highest revenue in season 3 ($4.9 million) and lowest in season 1 ($2.2 million).
- **Rider Demographics:** 81.17% are registered riders, and 18.83% are casual riders.

## Recommendations
### Pricing Strategy
- **Conservative Increase:** Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market's response without risking a significant loss of customers.
- **Price Setting:** If the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49, while a 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.
- **Recommended Strategy:**
  - **Market Analysis:** Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes, and the overall economic environment. This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested increase.
  - **Segmented Pricing Strategy:** Consider different pricing for casual versus registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities.
  - **Monitor and Adjust:** Implement the new prices but be ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Monitoring closely will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without committing fully to a price that might turn out to be too high.
